## PieceMeal

### Introduction
Anyone who cook or bake knows that finding ingredients for a recipe is an tedious task. It is even more irritating when you don't have a particular ingredient in your pantry. Piecemeal is a web application that aims to solve this problem. Imagine if you could just click on any item in the ingredient list and a small bubble would pop up, listing all the possible substitutable ingredients.

### Future Development 
We also have thought of various additions that could be added to possible future versions, such as information on cooking terms. For example, if you click on ‘saute’ a bubble will pop up and explain what that means, an option for the user to add substitutions that may be missing from our database, a way for a user to sign into an account and save recipes to create a virtual cookbook.
