Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Clos Du Val Merlot with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 30 dollars per bottle.",

Hints of herbs, black olives and toast are also present in the nose, leading to a well-structured wine with an abundance of dark red and black fruit flavors, balanced with sweet toast and some spice. The wine's soft tannins, lingering finish, and rich, complex taste make this a delightful accompaniment to roast chicken, pork, or beef.",

You can also use a sideburner on a grill or an open flame with a grate if camping. To test if properly heated, sprinkle a drop of water into the bottom of the skillet. If it dances, the skillet is properly heated.Drizzle olive oil into the bottom of the skillet and make sure it is well-coated.Place each steak into the skillet and cook over the medium heat for two minutes. Flip and cook the other side of the steak for about two minutes. Test for doneness. Cook longer if needed to reach the level of doneness desired.Remove from heat and allow to rest for about five minutes in the skillet.Cream together butter, Gorgonzola cheese, and fresh parsley.Place one tablespoon of herbed butter onto the top of each steak and allow to melt over the sides as serving.",
