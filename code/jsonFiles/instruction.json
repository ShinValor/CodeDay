Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Director's Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.",

        "description": "Our 2014 Director's Merlot offers lushness and a round, full palate. Its fragrance demonstrates red and black fruit with hints of anise and spiced wood. Juicy upon entry, the wine broadens and becomes velvety on the palate with flavors of plum, loganberry and black cherry accentuated by subtle spice notes of espresso bean and toasted vanilla. Medium tannins support the body of this wine, offering sophistication in its finish. Pairs nicely with brisket, grilled pork chops and linguine with pesto.",

Remove from the refrigerator about 30 minutes prior to cooking in order for the steaks to reach room temperature before cooking.Heat large, heavy cast iron skillet over medium heat. You can also use a sideburner on a grill or an open flame with a grate if camping. To test if properly heated, sprinkle a drop of water into the bottom of the skillet. If it dances, the skillet is properly heated.Drizzle olive oil into the bottom of the skillet and make sure it is well-coated.Place each steak into the skillet and cook over the medium heat for two minutes. Flip and cook the other side of the steak for about two minutes. Test for doneness. Cook longer if needed to reach the level of doneness desired.Remove from heat and allow to rest for about five minutes in the skillet.Cream together butter, Gorgonzola cheese, and fresh parsley.Place one tablespoon of herbed butter onto the top of each steak and allow to melt over the sides as serving.",
